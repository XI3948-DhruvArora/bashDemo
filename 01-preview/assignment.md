# What is bash?


Bash (short for "Bourne-Again Shell") is a Unix shell, which is a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. It is the default shell on Linux and macOS systems, and it can also be installed on Windows systems. Bash provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system by executing commands and scripts. It provides a wide range of features including command line editing, command history, job control, and shell scripting capabilities, which makes it a powerful tool for automating tasks, managing files and directories, and performing system administration tasks. Bash also allows users to customize their environment, such as setting environment variables, creating aliases, and defining functions, which can make working on the command line more efficient.


# What is scripting?

Scripting refers to the process of creating scripts, which are sets of instructions that are executed by a script interpreter. Scripts can be written in a variety of languages, such as Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript. The purpose of a script is to automate tasks and perform repetitive actions, such as managing files and directories, creating backups, automating system administration tasks, and more. Scripts can be run from the command line, or they can be integrated into other programs to provide additional functionality. Scripts can also be used to create simple programs that can be run on a computer without the need for a compiler.
